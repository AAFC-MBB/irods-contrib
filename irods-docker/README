This set of files can be used to create a Docker image of a standalone iRODS iCAT server
or an iCAT server paired with the idrop-web2 web-based graphical client authenticating with PAM/Kerberos.

This set of files can be used to create a Docker image of a standalone iRODS iCAT server,
 an iCAT server paired with the iDrop Web 2 web-based graphical client, or a standalone
 iRODS client with iCommands installed.

To create and instantiate the server, use the following instructions.

1. Locate the files in a single directory (known below as "path")..
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Rename the Dockerfile you would like to use (Dockerfile.icat or 
   Dockerfile.idrop) to Dockerfile.
3. Edit or replace the custom local details file .config as required
4. Run "docker build -t [repo/tag] [path]"
5. Use "docker run -t [repo/tag]" to start the docker image.
=======
2. Build the image you will need:
   - "docker build -t [repo]/icat:4.1.3 [path]/icat"
   - "docker build -t [repo]/idrop-web2:4.1.3 [path]/idrop-web2"
   - "docker build -t [repo]/icommands:4.1.3 [path]/icommands"
3. Use "docker run -t [repo/tag]" to start the docker image.

Notes:
* The iCAT image exposes port 1247 for iRODS.
* iRODS and Postgres passwords are randomly generated at runtime. You may specify an iRODS
  rodsadmin password as a command line argument to "docker run".
* These images do not include supervisord or sshd. To access a terminal use "docker exec"
  e.g., "docker exec -ti [container-id] /bin/bash"
* The iDrop Web 2 image exposes ports 80 and 1247.
* The iDrop Web 2 image uses a script to update the URL of iDrop Web links. The URL stub
  will be of the form http://[$DOCKER_HOSTNAME]:[$DOCKER_PORT80]. You must specify
  these variables on the "docker run" commandline.

Example syntax:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Once running...
* You can ssh to the box with "ssh -p [ssh redirect] admin@localhost"
* The admin password is $ADMINPW  (see .config)
* $RODSUN is the only iRODS user, with password $RODSPW   (see .config)
=======
iCAT only (loaded as background process)-
  docker run -p [port 1247 redirect]:1247 -d -t irods/icat:4.1.3 [new rodsadmin password]

iCAT + iDrop Web 2 (loaded as background process)-
  docker run -p [port 1247 redirect]:1247 -p [port 80 redirect]:80 \
  -e DOCKER_PORT80=[port 80 redirect] -e DOCKER_HOSTNAME=[hostname of the host machine] \
  -d -t irods/idrop-web2:4.1.3 [new rodsadmin password]

iCommands (loaded as foreground process)-
  docker run -ti irods/icommands:4.1.3
